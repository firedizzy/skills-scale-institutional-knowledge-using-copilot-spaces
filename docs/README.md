# OctoAcme — Project Management Overview

OctoAcme runs projects with a lightweight, outcome-focused lifecycle that moves work from initiation through planning, execution, release, and retrospective. New ideas begin with a one‑pager that captures the problem, measurable success criteria, stakeholders, and a high‑level timeline. When those success metrics and stakeholder alignment are confirmed, the initiative moves into planning where work is broken into shippable increments, estimated, and mapped into a release plan with clear milestones.

Day‑to‑day delivery uses a project board (Backlog → Ready → In Progress → In Review → QA → Done) and a disciplined pull request process that favors small PRs, linked issues with acceptance criteria, automated CI checks, and required approvals before merging. Backlog items follow a standard template (title, description, acceptance criteria, estimate, owner) and sprint planning is timeboxed so only items that meet the Definition of Done are pulled into the iteration. Teams maintain a simple Risk Register and mark cross‑team dependencies for escalation during weekly syncs.

Roles are explicit to ensure clear ownership: Product Managers define outcomes and prioritize the backlog, Project Managers coordinate schedules, risks, and stakeholder communication, Developers implement and test features, and QA validates acceptance criteria and runs manual checks when needed. The team rhythm includes daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos, and regular PM+PdM alignment to keep stakeholders informed and decisions timely.

Quality and release practices are built into the cadence: unit and integration tests, end‑to‑end smoke tests for critical flows, and security scanning run in CI. Releases require passing checks, drafted release notes, smoke verification in staging and production, and a rollback/incident playbook for remediation. Action items from retrospectives are converted into backlog work so improvements are measurable and iterative.
