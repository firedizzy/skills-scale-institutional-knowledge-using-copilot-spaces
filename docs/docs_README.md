# OctoAcme Project Management Docs

Welcome — this folder contains OctoAcme's program and delivery process documentation. These docs provide a concise, actionable set of practices and templates to onboard team members, run projects, and maintain consistent delivery.

## Summary of Project Management Processes
OctoAcme uses a structured, iterative approach focused on delivering customer value and keeping knowledge discoverable:

- Customer-first and iterative delivery: small, testable increments with measurable outcomes.
- Clear roles and responsibilities: Project Manager, Product Manager, Developers, QA, and Stakeholders.
- Defined lifecycle: Initiation → Planning → Execution → Release → Retrospective.
- Regular cadence: daily standups, weekly delivery syncs, sprint demos, and retrospectives.
- Risk & communication: a lightweight risk register, weekly status updates, and escalation paths.
- Continuous improvement: action items from retrospectives are tracked and validated.

Refer to the linked documents below for templates, checklists, and detailed guidance.
